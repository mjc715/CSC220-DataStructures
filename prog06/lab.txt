1. Finish Jumble.java.  There are two exercises.  Verify that you
   cannot unscramble zagboe using word (the dictionary file I gave you
   last week).

   I put a bigger dictionary file called dict into prog06.  Verify
   that Jumble can unscramble zagboe using dict.


2. Implement find in LinkedMap.java.  Use TestLinkedMap.java to test.


3. Implement add in LinkedMap.java.  Use TestLinkedMap to test.


4. Finish get.  If the entry is the one you want, return its value.

   Finish put.  If the entry is the one you want, set its value.  What
   do you return?


5. In Jumble.main, comment out the line with TreeMap and uncomment the
   one with LinkedMap.  How long does it take to load word?  Can you
   unscramble retupmoc?  How about zagboe?  Try dict for that one...


HOMEWORK

6. Implement remove(Entry entry).  Add tests to TestLinkedQueue to
   test it.


7. Implement remove(Object keyAsObject).  In Jumble, remove each key
   after you add it, check that is is not there (print a warning if it
   IS still there), and then add it back again.  Test.


8. Implement Iter.  Test.


9. In SkipMap, follow the instructions to finish put and find.  Switch
   to SkipMap in Jumble, comment out the warning from #7 (because you
   haven't implemented SkipMap remove yet), and test on dict.  Faster?


10. Implement SkipMap remove and test (put back the warning).
