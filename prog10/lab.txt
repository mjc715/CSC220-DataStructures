1. Implement HashTable.put.  Output in step1.txt.

2. Implement find.  Output in step2.txt.

   Copy Jumble.java (whatever is your latest version) to prog10 and
   change the package on top.  Modify it to use HashTable for its Map.
   Load in words and look up retupmuc and obezag.  Try to load dict
   instead.  Pretty slow, right?  (Kill it.)

3. Implement rehash.  Output in step3.txt.

   Now try to load dict in Jumble.  It should be fast.  Look up
   obezag.

HOMEWORK

4. Implement remove.  Output in step4.txt.

5. Implement EntryIterator.  Output in step5.txt.

Do steps 10 and 11 from last time.

If you did them already, just copy Jumble.java to prog10 and change
the package at the top.

I will only check the Jumble.java in this directory.
