1. In Heap, the parent, left, and right (index) of index is
   parent(index), left(index), and right(index).
   isRoot(index) is true if index is the root (index==0).
   The element at index is less than its parent if
	compare(index, parent(index)) < 0   
   To swap the element at index with its parent:
	index = swap(index, parent(index))

   offer() adds a new element to the end and sets index to the index
   of the new element (size()-1).

   Add a loop:
     while (the element at) index is less than its parent,
        swap it with its parent.

   Test output is heap-offer.txt.


2. isValid(index) is true if 0<=index<size(). The element at
   index has a left child if isValid(left(index)) is true.
   index has a right child if isValid(right(index)) is true.

   Add a loop to poll():
   while (the element at) index is greater than its left or right child,
      swap it with its smallest child.

   Use compare and swap as in #1 except left(index) and/or
   right(index) instead of parent(index).

   Keep in mind that it may not have either or it may have a left
   child but not a right child.  If it has only one child, then that's
   its smallest child.  Otherwise you have to compare them.

   Test output is heap-poll.txt.


3. BST (Binary Search Tree) is an implementation of Map.  The Entry
   class has data, left, and right.  In a binary search tree, left is
   less and right is greater.

   Implement the (private) BST find method using the notes.  Methods
   in BST should use RECURSION not iteration.  Implement get.  (Look
   at containsKey.)  Your get should not call containsKey and should
   have only one call to find.  (What does find return if the key is
   not there?)


4. Implement the private add method using the notes.  Remember, you
   must put the value returned by the recursive call to add() in the
   right place (or left place :-).

   Now, implement the public put method using add.  What do you do
   with the value add returns?

   Test the program.  The output should be as in bst-put.txt, only
   the removes won't happen.

   Copy prog06/Jumble.java to prog07 and change the package at the top
   to prog07 (if this does not happen automatically).  Switch it to
   using BST.  Does it work with words?  How fast can it load dict?


HOMEWORK

DUE WEDNESDAY MARCH 9

5. Copy your Game.java (snow to rain game) from prog05 to prog07 and
   change the package to prog07 at the top.

   a. Add a method that returns the number of letters two words
      differ.  For example lettersDifferent("said", "rain") is 2.
      Position matters so lettersDifferent("arin", "rain") is also 2.
      You can assume the words have the same length.

  static int lettersDifferent (String word, String target) {

   b. Add a method the determines the distance of an Node back to the
      start word by counting how many times you can follow next
      before reaching null.

  int distanceToStart (Node node) {

   c. Create a Comparator class for Node inside Game:

  protected class NodeComparator implements Comparator<Node> {

      Its constructor should take the target word as an argument and
      save it in the class.

      It should also have a priority method that returns the sum of
      the distance to start and the letters different from the target:

    int priority (Node node) {

      The compare method, required by the interface, returns the
      difference of priorities.

   d. Download TestNodeComparator.java from the course web site/prog07.
      If your Node class is private, you will have to make it protected.
      Run it.


3. If you haven't yet, you will need to finish solve from the prog06
   homework.

   Add code to solve so it displays a message about how many times it
   polls the queue.  (Poll is expensive because you have the check the
   entire dictionary for neighbors.)  You should get 481 for "snow" to
   "rain".

   Copy all of solve and call the new method solve2.  In solve2, use a
   PriorityQueue (import java.util.PriorityQueue) as the Queue.  Give
   its constructor a new NodeComparator on the target word.0

   Add a button for solve2.  It should report only 117 polls (epic!) but
   now take eight steps to get from snow to rain (brutal!).


4. Implement the remove method in Heap.  Test output is
   heap-remove.txt.


5. In Game, copy solve2 to solve3 and add another button.
   Currently, we only accept a nextNode if it is not the start node,
   its next is null, and it is one letter different from theNode.

   Add an else if whose condition is nextNode is not the start node
   and is one letter different from theNode and its distance to start
   is greater than theNode's plus 1.  In other words, we HAVE seen it
   before but now we have found a shorter path to it.

   If that condition is true, set the next of nextNode to
   theNode, remove nextNode from the queue and offer it to the queue
   again.

   Add a button for solve3.  Now it should get from snow to rain in
   only seven steps using only 74 polls!


LAB ON MARCH 9

8. Change the first line of the public remove method.  Implement the
   private remove method based on the notes.  It will call removeRoot.


9. Implement removeRoot.  It will call getMinimum and removeMinimum.
   The entry returned by getMinimum becomes the root.


10. Implement getMinimum and removeMinimum.  Correct output in
    bst-remove.txt.
