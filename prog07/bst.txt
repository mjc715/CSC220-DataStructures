A binary search tree is ordered so that everything in the left subtree
of each entry has lesser key that that entry and everything in the right
subtree has greater key.  This enables to find the entry with a given
key quickly.

find(key, root):  find the entry with key in the tree rooted at root
	tree is empty?  return null
	key is at root?  return root
	key < root key?  recursively find in left subtree
	key > root key?  recursively find in right subtree

Entry find (K key, Entry root) {
	if (root == null)
		return null;
        if (key.compareTo(root.key) == 0)
		return root;
        if (key.compareTo(root.key) < 0)
		return find(key, root.left);
	else
		return find(key, root.right);


	               3
	       1               5
	           2       4       9

Let's say you are looking for key==4.  Root has key==3.
Root is not null.
key is not less than root key.
So recursively look in right tree, rooted at key==5.

If you believe in recursion, we are done.  But maybe you are not sure, so...

	Root has key==5.
	Root is not null.
	key is less than root key.
	So recursively look in left tree, rooted at key==4.

		Root has key==4.
		Root is not null.
		key equals root key.
		Return entry with key==4.

	Return entry with key==4.

Return entry with key==4.


add(K key, V value, Entry root)
	tree is empty?  return new Entry with key and value
	key < root key?  recursively add to left subtree
			 and replace current left subtree with result
			 and return root
	key > root key?  recursively add to right subtree
			 and replace current right subtree with result
			 and return root

Why return root?  Well suppose the input key==6 and root is the entry
with key==3.  (Let's not worry about values.)

	               3
	       1               5
	           2       4       9

This is the result.  Well, what is the root of this tree?  The entry
with key==3, right?  So that is what you should return.

	               3
	       1               5
	           2       4       9
	                         6

Removing a entry is the trickiest.  Suppose we wanted to remove the 3.
That would split the tree into two.

	                
	       1               5
	           2       4       9
	                         6


The fix is to replace it by the rightmost entry in the left subtree or
the leftmost entry in the right subtree:

	               2
	       1               5
	                   4       9
	                         6

OR

	               4 
	       1               5
	           2               9
	                         6

Entry remove(key, root)
	key == root.key? return removeRoot(root)
	key < root.key? recursive call on left tree
	key > root.key? recursive call on right tree

Entry removeRoot(root)
	left subtree is empty?  return right subtree
	right subtree is empty?  return left subtree
        Use getMinimum to get the minimum (leftmost) entry in the right subtree.
        That will be the new root.
        Use removeMinimum to remove the minimum entry from the right subtree.
        Copy the left and right subtree of root to the new root.
        Return the new root.

Entry getMinimum(root)
	left subtree is empty?  return root
        Use getMinimum to get the minimum in the left subtree and return it.

Entry removeMinimum(root)
	left subtree is empty?  return right subtree
        Remove the minimum of the left subtree.
        Return root.
