0. How many cycles per second in a GHz (giga Hertz)?

1 billion


CORRECT



1. Which power of 2 is closest to a million?  What is the nearest integer to
   log 1000000?
      2

2^20, 20


CORRECT


2. What is the minimum time to the nearest second that a computer with 16 GB RAM
   and a quad (4) core 2 GHz processor can locate all bytes in its RAM which are
   set to 'V'?


2 seconds


CORRECT


3. Give at least two reasons why it is a harder task for Google to find the best
   ten web pages with Victor Milenkovic on them (compared to #2).


"Victor Milenkovic" is larger than just "V" and Google is limited by internet speeds.





CORRECT



4. If a single weighing can determine that a pile of coins contains one real coin,
   how many weighings does it take to locate the one real coin in a pile of 1000?


It takes 10 weighings.



CORRECT


5. Same question, pile of n?

Weighings = log(n) / log(2)

CORRECT


public class Computer {
    private int ramSize;	// gibibytes
    private double speed;	// gigaHertz

}

6. Why doesn't Laptop.getPower compile and what are two ways to fix it?

It doesn't work because ramSize and speed are private variables and can't be 
accessed by the Laptop class. It can be fixed by either using the getRamSize and
getSpeed methods instead or changing the ramSize and speed variables to protected
instead of private.



CORRECT







After you fix Laptop.getPower, what will the following code (#7-#9) do?
Answer compiler error, runtime exception, or what it prints out.

7. 	Computer c = new Laptop(8, 2.5, 7.5);
	System.out.println(c.getWeight());


7.5
WRONG: compiler error


8. 	Computer c = new Laptop(8, 2.5, 7.5);
	System.out.println(c.getPower());

10.0
CORRECT


9. 	Computer c = new Computer(16, 3.0);
	Laptop l = (Laptop) c;
	System.out.println(l.getPower());

24.0
WRONG: runtime error
