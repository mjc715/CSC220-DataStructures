+1   0. LinkedQueue<E> uses a linked list with the following Node class.  It has Node
   variables top and bottom and int variable size.  Implement offer.

	class Node {
		E element;
		Node next;
		Node (E element) { this.element = element; this.next = null; }
	}

  	boolean offer (E element) {

		Node newNode = new Node<E>(element);
		if (size == 0) {
			top = newNode;
			bottom = top;
			++size;
		} else {
			bottom.next = newNode;
			bottom = newNode;
			++size;
		}
		




+1.5   1,2. Write a method INSIDE LinkedQueue<E> that prints out all the elements from top
   to bottom on separate lines.

   private void print () {
   
	for (	Node n ; n = top; n = n.next) ***Node n = top; n!= null


		System.out.println(n.element);

   }


+1   3. ArrayQueue<E> uses an E[] array theElements and int variables first and size.
   Implement ArrayQueue<E< poll.  Don't forget the empty case.

	E poll () {

		if (isEmpty()) {
			return null;
		}
		E obj = theElements[first];
		++first;
		--size;
		if(first == theElements.length) {
			first = 0;
		}
		return obj;
	}











+2    4,5. Write a method INSIDE ArrayQueue<E> that prints out all the elements from first
   onwards.

   private void print () {
   
	for (int offset = 0; offset < size; ++offset	  ) {
		


		System.out.println(theElements[(first + offset) % theElements.length];				);

   }

+0.75   6. Suppose ArrayQueue<String> has an array theElements of length 5 with the
   following contents:

	null, "had", "a", "little", "lamb"

   Suppose first==1 and size==4.  (Zero based indexing!!!)

   After offer("fleece"), what are the contents of the array and the values of
   first and size?  Would your answer be different if the null had been "Mary"?
	Array: "fleece" "had" "a" "little" "lamb"
	first = 1; size = 5;


yes   **** Wouldn't change bc size stays the same







+1   7. Continuing from #6 (disregarding my question about "Mary"), after offer("white),
   what are the contents of theElements and the values of first and size?

	
	Array: "had" "a" "little" "lamb" "fleece" "white" null null null null
	first = 0
	size = 5





+0.5   8. Write a method that takes a queue as input and returns a String that is the
   contents of the queue separated by spaces.  There can be an extra space at the end.

	void queueToString (Queue<String> queue) {
		String s = "";


		for (String s : queue) { *** For string element (have 2 strings)
			s = s + " ";
		}



                return s;
	}


+1.0 9. The methods of AbstractQueue<E> work by calling the methods that YOU WROTE
   yesterday.  How can AbstractQueue<E> implement remove() by calling the poll() and
   size() you implemented?  Remember, remove() should throw NoSuchElementException
   if there is no element to remove.

	E remove () {
		if (size = 0) {
			throw new NoSuchElementException;
		}
		return poll();
	}
