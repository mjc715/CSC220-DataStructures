name = ui.getInfo("What is your name?");
if (name == null) {
	ui.sendMessage("Blank names are not allowed");
	break;
}

   class have methods OTHER than those in the interface it implements?  (Hint:

Yes. Yes.

CORRECT

4. If name1="Victor and name2="Vincent", then name1.compareTo(name2) is -11

WRONG, 4



You are testing your homework, but you have not implemented find yet, so the
directory will not yet be in alphabetical order.  You look at the contents of
theDirectory using the debugger.  What you see is below.  Show the result of a
single operation described in 5, 6, 7, or 8.  Each question is INDEPENDENT and
refers to the original theDirectory below.  Each time pretend that is the ONLY
OPERATION you do.

  theDirectory:  Jay 1, Bob 8, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null, null


5. Result of ArrayBasedPD.remove(1).  (Remember, [1] is Bob!!)

Jay 1, Eve 6, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null

INCORRECT 1/2 : 2 nulls

6. Result of SortedPD.remove(1).

Jay 1, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null, null

INCORRECT 1/2: 2 Eves

7. Result of ArrayBasedPD.add(1, new DirectoryEntry("Zoe", 7)).  (Only change two locations!)

Jay 1, Zoe 7, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null null, Ian 2

INCORRECT

8. Result of SortedPD.add(1, new DirectoryEntry("Zoe", 7)).


Jay 1, Zoe 7, Bob 8, Ian 2, Ann 3, Eve 6, null, null

INCORRECT 1/2: one null

9. What is the name of the web directory that contains quizzes and solutions?
